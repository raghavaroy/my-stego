That sounds like an interesting and practical project! Steganography is widely used for secure communication by hiding data within images. Your project can focus on techniques like **LSB (Least Significant Bit) substitution**, **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) steganography**, or **AES-encrypted steganography** for added security.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure your project:

### **1. Introduction**
- Explain what **steganography** is and why itâ€™s useful.
- Discuss the importance of **secure data hiding** in digital communication.
- Compare it with other encryption methods.

### **2. Literature Survey**
- Explore existing steganography techniques.
- Compare methods like **LSB, DCT, DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)**, and **spread spectrum**.

### **3. Methodology**
- **Image Preprocessing**: Choose the image format (JPEG, PNG).
- **Data Encoding**: Hide the secret message in the image using **LSB substitution** or other methods.
- **Security Enhancements**: Encrypt the data before hiding it.
- **Extraction Process**: Retrieve the hidden message from the image.

### **4. Implementation**
- Use **Python** with libraries like **OpenCV, PIL, NumPy** for image processing.
- Implement **LSB Steganography** (simplest method).
- Optional: Use **AES encryption** for added security.
- Develop a **GUI** using Tkinter or a web interface for ease of use.

### **5. Results and Analysis**
- Test the system with different images and data sizes.
- Compare **image quality before and after embedding** (using PSNR & MSE).
- Check **robustness against attacks** like noise addition or compression.

### **6. Conclusion**
- Summarize the effectiveness of the approach.
- Suggest improvements like deep learning-based steganography.
